This is the python algorithm which was used to analyze cell track data for the publication 'Enterobacter Sp. SM3 Exhibits Run-and-Tumble Motility'. 

DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.8066768

To run this program, download the file 'Cell Track Analysis Algorithm' in either .py or .pynb format as well as the included sample trajectory named 'sample_trajectory.csv'

Then, using your prefered GUI such as Spyder or Jupytr notebook, open the program and modify the file path in cell two labeled 'Imports data'

Run every cell of the program by pressing Shift+Enter. You should see a velocity readout as well as multiple plots with accompanying run-and-tumble data

If the program fails to run, try keeping the program file and the data file 'sample_trajectory.csv' in the same folder
